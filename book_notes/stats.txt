Frequency spectrum plots provide valuable information about the nature of a pro-
cess: if, as is the case with ri-, a process is characterized by a high proportion of
hapax legomena and other low frequency classes, this indicates that the process is
productive, i.e., the chances that if we were to sample more tokens of the same
category we would encounter new types are high. Baroni and Evert 5
	show this with Vm(*.spc, 1)/N(*.spc)

A vocabulary growth curve reports vocabulary size
5(number of types, V ) as a function of sample size (number of tokens, N ).

1. prove that certain works are richer in vocabulary(historical phenomenon? genre? authorial preference?)
	hapax ratio and vgc
2. find f the vocab is "new" or rare (or regional/coloquial)
	hapax, dis, tris versus google or davies 
3. does this account for better "reader identification" with some texts than others
	more reader identification=more sense of national identity

eliminating attached do and io in order to avoid them appearing as hapax
